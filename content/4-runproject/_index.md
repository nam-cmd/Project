### Run Project

1. After the Verified Access endpoint is created and switched to active state.

The next step is to create a new record: a C-name record (CNAME) with the subdomain name "HR" to match the application domain.

We go back to Route53 > Hosted zones in use > Create record

Record name(Record name): hr.

Record type(Record type): CNAME â€“ Routes traffic to another domain name and to some AWS resources.

Value: endpoint domain taken from Verified Access endpoints.

Click the Create record button.

2. After completing these configuration steps, to test the application, we need to open a new window in the browser and enter the URL: <https://hr.Yourdomain.com>. Here my domain name is: https://hr.builder.id.com. Our Wb page will appear.

Next, enter the email address and password of user 1 that we created in the cognito user pools section and click Sign in.

Next, the website will ask us to change the password for user1, enter the new password and click Send.

After clicking Send, we have logged into the HR application welcome to the HR.

Next, we open a new tab and log in with user2, the steps are the same as with user1. But the login is not successful.

Because when we set up the Verified Access trust provider, we configured a Cognito policy to only grant access to users with verified email(user1). Therefore, users with unverified email will not be granted access(user2).
